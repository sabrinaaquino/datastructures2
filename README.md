## Week 01
This week covers the basics of using Git and Github for version control and collaboration. You will also be introduced to the fundamentals of programming with Python, such as processing numerical and text data, creating variables and lists, and analyzing data using for loops and conditional statements.

Topics covered:

* Course Outline
* Git and Version Control
* Python for Data Engineering: Fundamentals Part I
## Week 02
This week covers dictionaries, functions, and object-oriented programming in Python. You will also gain practical experience applying your newly acquired data skills in a data project that you can showcase in your portfolio.

Topics covered:

* Data Structure Preliminaries: Dictionaries, Functions and OOP
* Python for Data Engineering: Fundamentals Part II
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Introduction
## Week 03
This week covers linked lists, queues, and stacks. You will learn about the benefits of using linked nodes when creating data structures and gain an understanding of the FIFO and LIFO data structures and process scheduling algorithms.

Topics covered:

Data Structure Preliminaries: Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks
* Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
